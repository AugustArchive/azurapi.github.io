# Equipment Information
Same as Ships, this section contains all the Functions and Results developers should get for Equipment and resultant JSON is provided on the right. As usual, Developers should able to provide their own error checking for misspelt names and other user centric input checks prior to checking the library for the statistics
## Resulting Information
> The Resultant JSON is structured like this:

```json
{
  "wikiUrl": "String",
  "category": "String",
  "names": {
    "en": "String",
    "cn": "String",
    "jp": "String",
    "kr": "String"
  },
  "type": { "focus": "String", "name": "String" },

  "nationality": "String",
  "image": "String",
  "fits": {
    "destroyer": "String",
    "lightCruiser": "String",
    "heavyCruiser": "String",
    "monitor": "String",
    "largeCruiser": "String",
    "battleship": "String",

    "aviationBattleship": null,
    "aircraftCarrier": null,
    "lightCarrier": null,

  },
  "tiers": {
    "T0": { "tier": "String", "rarity": "String", "stars": [Object], "stats": [Object] }
  }
}
```
## Equipment Query By Name
By Default, it is recommended to use the Multilingual Language to detect and display information provided by the users, it will automatically detect by its language and quary its result.

```javascript
import { getEquipment  } from '@azurapi/azurapi' //ES6
//const { getEquipment  } = require('@azurapi/azurapi') ES5
console.log(getEquipment('z23'))
```
```python
api.getEquipment('z23')
```

This Table allows you to configure the type of language as a point of reference in name detection

| Languages      | Method                     | Alternative Method   |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Multilingual   | getEquipment               | getEquipmentByName   |
